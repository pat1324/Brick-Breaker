# Brick-Breaker
Small brick breaker game written with Processing in Java

Run the brick breaker game from inside processing to begin the game.
brick_breaker.pde must be placed in a folder inside the Processing folder where all projects are kept.
Left click to start the game.
Use mouse position to control the paddle.
When all the bricks are cleared the game is won and a "You Won!" message is displayed.
If all 5 balls are lost (hit the bottom of the screen) then the game is lost and a "Game Over" message is displayed.

-- Bugs --

-Setting the speed up high will glitch the ball through the bricks (still breaking them) and scorekeeping is miscalculated.

-Will occasionally need an extra click to start the game (difficult to reproduce).

-The ball can be trapped inside the paddle from one end and be shot out the other (bug or feature? :O).
